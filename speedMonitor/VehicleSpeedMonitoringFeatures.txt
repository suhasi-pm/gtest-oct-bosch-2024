Monitoring system for vehicle speed with random data, which is used for testing where speed data needs to be checed with threshold and communicated to a server.

IOTCloudCommunicator:
pushMessage sends a message to a cloud server and returns a status code:
Codes 200–400 indicate successful communication.
Codes 400–500 indicate an error.
The status code is randomly generated.

BNFSpeedSensor:
getCurrentSpeed gets the vehicle's current speed in km/h.
The speed is randomly chosen between 1 and 100 km/h.

SpeedMonitor:
Contains a speed threshold, _speedThreshold.
monitor function for checking if the speed exceeds the threshold.

Monitor function does the following things:
Threshold Check: _speedThreshold is checked between 1 and 100. If it falls outside this range, a message is printed to indicate invalid threshold.

Current Speed Check: BNFSpeedSensor is created to get the current speed. The current speed is displayed in km/h.

 If the current speed exceeds _speedThreshold, it’s converted to miles per hour (mph).
 A message with the speed in mph is created and sent to IOTCloudCommunicator via pushMessage.

Communication Check: If the status code is above 400, indicating an error, a message is printed to indicate a communication failure.
