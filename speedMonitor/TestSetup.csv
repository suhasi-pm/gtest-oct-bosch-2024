TestCaseName,Description,Input/Preconditons,Expected Output
SpeedThresholdOutOfRange,Test if an invalid speedThreshold (outside range 1â€“100) produces an error message,speedThreshold below 0 or above 100,Error message: "_speedThreshold value must be in the range {1-100} X"
SpeedBelowThreshold,Test when the current speed is below the threshold,_speedThreshold within {1-100} getCurrentSpeed() set it below the _speedThreshold,No alert message is displayed since the current speed is below the threshold
SpeedAboveThresholdCommunicationOK,Test when the current speed is above the threshold, and communication succeeds,_speedThreshold within {1-100} getCurrentSpeed()=set it above _speedThreshold pushMessage() to be within {200-400},Displays: "Current Speed In Kmph X" confirming the speed and communication success
SpeedAboveThresholdCommunicationNOK,Test when the current speed is above the threshold but communication fails,_speedThreshold within {1-100} getCurrentSpeed()=set it above _speedThreshold pushMessage() to be within {400-500},Displays error: "Error In Communication Unable to Contact Server Current Speed in Miles X"
